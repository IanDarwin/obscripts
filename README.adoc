= obscripts - Scripts for OpenBSD

These scripts may or may not be useful on OpenBSD. They're primarily
system administration scripts, many requiring root; do not run them
without knowing what they do, how they work, and how they may fail!
They are provided without warranty. USE AT OWN RISK.

The scripts mostly use OpenBSD-specific tools like package management,
or filesystem-layout-specific paths, and so on.

The easiest way to use most of them is to git clone this repo in 
your home directory, and add its directory to your PATH.

There is at least one - prepsusp - that will work better if you
copy it to / so you don't have to have /home mounted when
running it.

As with all root scripts, read them over to be sure I'm not
trying to pwn you (or that my github account hasn't been hacked).

If you find this useful, consider contributing back, either changes,
man pages?, or your own scripts. Git pull, or patches.
