# Shortcut sysupgrade from a sysupgraded machine to upgrade another machine on LAN
# Use ONLY after:
#	(a) successfully doing sysupgrade on this machine
#	(b) Making sure the remote host is the same arch!
#	(c) If the remote is pre-6.5, you've upgraded the boot blocks to 6.5+
# Be aware that sysupgrade will only fetch release OR snaps depending on what
# you run it on, and 6.5 release did not include necessary functionality,
# so you might have to upgrade from the console the first time!
# Don't run under doas because you dont want to ssh as root.
# Lightly tested on i386 and amd64 - use at own risk!
